# La cyberguerre : l’autre destruction mutuelle assurée

Nicole Perlroth: “But what they haven't done until now is pulled the trigger on the access and the capabilities. And I suspect that is because we have stumbled into a new era of mutually assured digital destruction. Where yes, they might be in our systems. Yes. We recently declassified a report that said that Chinese have been probing our pipelines to get a foothold in the event of some escalating geopolitical conflict. But I've also reported that cyber command has hacked the Russian grid. So we're all in each other's systems. And so no one actually wants to pull the trigger because they know that the minute they do that their adversary could do the same back to them. So we do have a little bit of this very messy, mutually assured digital destruction. And I think that's why attribution becomes critical.”
